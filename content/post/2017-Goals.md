Just wanted to write down a few things I intend to do in the new year. Only really writing it down to make myself obligated to it.

- Complete some web stack development courses on PluralSight. It's been a while since I touched Angular,Django, and I wouldn't mind getting something done from start to finish.

- Get a basic app up and running on iOS from scratch. I've ported Unity stuff to iOS, but nothing much else.

- Participate in more game jams. I think I did .5 game jams last year, let's see if I can bump that up a little. It certainly helped me explore stuff and fail faster, especially in VR.

- Sub goal: Hopefully one of the above spins to a pet project that I grind out more on.

- Start streaming more. Don't really know what game, or when, but I enjoyed what little I did in 2016.

- Maybe do a speed run of something? Not expecting anything close, just wouldn't mind chasing at a record of something for a bit, even if I have no chance to get it.

- Cut soda.
