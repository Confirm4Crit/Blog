Been fiddling with Hugo the past week, tweaking the site here and there to fit what I need.

It's been exciting hosting my own little site to hold all of **me**. Resume, portfolio, personal thoughts, etc. I had too much moving around, Tumblr, Twitter, all my AscendedAlpaca blogs, etc. Nice just to have it all *here*.

I also got my first pull request excepted. It's insignificant, but it was need feeling contributing to a project.

[Here it is](https://github.com/yoshiharuyamashita/blackburn/pull/31), if anyone cares. I added a Tumblr social link on my own to the side bar, so I figured to slap in on the main theme, and it got accepted.

Feels neat.
