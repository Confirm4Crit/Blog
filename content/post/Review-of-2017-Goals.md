It's the time of year where you muse over a list of things you'll try to get done and fail, so let's review the last set!

- Complete some web stack development courses on PluralSight. It's been a while since I touched Angular,Django, and I wouldn't mind getting something done from start to finish.
    * This kind of happened? I ended up digging into a lot of MEAN/React, and tilted over to machine learning for some work research. Need to do this with .NET Core.

- Get a basic app up and running on iOS from scratch. I've ported Unity stuff to iOS, but nothing much else.
    - Didn't get much going here at all. Would probably scrap this for next year.

- Participate in more game jams. I think I did .5 game jams last year, let's see if I can bump that up a little. It certainly helped me explore stuff and fail faster, especially in VR.
    - No? I put a question mark because I did a bunch of work outside of game development, espcially in SalesForce. So this is a maybe. Still some time this year, actually.

- Sub goal: Hopefully one of the above spins to a pet project that I grind out more on.
    - Nada

- Start streaming more. Don't really know what game, or when, but I enjoyed what little I did in 2016.
    - I did stream a bit of Eternal and Madden, but didn't do anything consistent.

- Maybe do a speed run of something? Not expecting anything close, just wouldn't mind chasing at a record of something for a bit, even if I have no chance to get it.
    - I hardly played anything in 2017. PUBG and MOBAs, that's about it.

- Cut soda.
    - Hahahahahhahahaha

Maybe the best thing to do for 2018 is to leave this list alone and actually accomplish it.
